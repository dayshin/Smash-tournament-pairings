built w Python/Flask and Django templates
just run 
``` python Pairings.py ``` 

this should open a page that asks for number of players. you submit # of players
it links you to who is against who and you input the winner until there's a winner. the end! 

next steps:
add react to make it more visual
allow inputs per round instead of per match
count who is out 
placing for everyone, not just spitting out winner
